This piece is for edgier customers who are looking for a wearable piece of free-form, organic sculpture that remains slightly grounded by the sparkle and color of the stones.</p>\n<p>I used a slightly different technique to create this ring than I do for most of my bands. I created the master over many weeks, carefully forming and adding branches and soldering each one by hand. Once I was happy with the form, I had the original cast by a master caster in New York (I\u2019ve worked with many casters and this is the only one who can accurately cast such an intricate, delicate design). Each ring is cast individually after adjusting the mold to size. I then finish the casting and add the stones by hand.</p>\n<p>This ring is perfect for someone who wants a piece of jewelry that will stop conversations as they enter the room. It\u2019s also a great anniversary or right-hand band. Please note that the shape of this ring necessitates a more delicate structure, however, so you might want to put it on AFTER your sweater.</p>\n<p>Please make your band choice from the drop-down menu and put your ring size(s) when checking out.</p>\n<p>_____________________________________________________________\n<br/>SPECS\n<br/>Back of band is approx. 6mm, Face from tip to tip is approx. 20mm.</p>\n<p>6 diamonds or sapphires in a  mix of stone sizes, with the largest approx. 2.5mm.</p>\n<p>The stone choices are designed for the specific material. In the gold, I use a combo of silvermist and lab diamonds. The silver and palladium use yellow sapphires. However, any color of diamond or sapphire could be substituted. If you\u2019re interested in making changes, get in touch with me at lolide@lolide.com</p>\n<p>This ring is available in 14K yellow gold, 14K palladium white gold, 18K yellow gold, sterling silver, and platinum.

Please get in touch for more on this option.</p>\n<p>In order to offset additional material and labor costs, ring sizes over 11.5 will incur an additional charge of $10 per quarter size for 950 palladium and $25 per quarter size for gold or palladium.</p>\n<p>___________________________________________________________________\n<br/>TURN AROUND TIME</p>\n<p>*** Please be sure to put your ring size(s) in the notes section at the bottom of the checkout page.

The subtly contrasting shades and finishes emphasize the depth of the sculptural \"pendant\" which is suspended from a sterling silver oxidized rolo chain.</p>\n<p>The necklace is finished with a handmade brushed sterling silver clasp. This necklace is designed to sit a few inches below the collarbone, but the chain can be lengthened or shortened upon request.</p>\n<p>This necklace is hand forged from oxidized and polished 20 gauge hammered and heated sterling silver wire and sterling silver rolo chain. The pendant is approx. 6 in. across and 2 in at its widest point. Total length with chain and clasp is 20 in. Length can be adjusted up or down upon request.</p>\n<p>Each necklace is a handmade work of art and will have slight variations. No two are just alike, part of their unique beauty. Similarly, each person's chemistry is different and changes the necklace over time, slightly burnishing it in places. This adds further depth and contrast, changing with you over time, yet remaining essentially the same.</p>\n<p>Please allow approx. 1-2 weeks to ship.
